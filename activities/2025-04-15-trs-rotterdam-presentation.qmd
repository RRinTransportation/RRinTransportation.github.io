Ruth Lu, an undergraduate researcher at MIT from our working group, gave our first conference presentation at the Transportation Research Symposium in Rotterdam, The Netherlands! We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the state of data and code availability in transportation research.

**Research Focus**
- Automated assessment of data availability in papers
- Code reproducibility metrics
- Insights into open science adoption in transportation

This presentation highlighted innovative uses of AI in evaluating reproducibility practices and supporting the shift towards open science.
