We organized a Call for Papers “Towards Reproducible Transportation Research” at TRB 2023, sponsored by ACP50: Traffic Flow Theory and Characteristics (primary sponsoring committee) and AEP40: Transportation Network Modeling Committee. More details of this event can be found here. As a result, a Lectern Session at TRB2023 was dedicated to Reproducible Transportation Research.
