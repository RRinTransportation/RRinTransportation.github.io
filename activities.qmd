## Current Activities

- We are guest-editing a topical collection on "Reproducible Research in Transportation" for [European Transport Research Review (ETRR)](https://etrr.springeropen.com/), which is a peer-reviewed open access journal publishing original high-quality scholarly research and developments in areas related to transportation science, technologies, policy and practice. **A call for papers has been released** [here](https://www.springeropen.com/collections/RRT24).

## Past Activities

### ITSC 2025 Tutorial

The half-day tutorial "Reproducibility in Transportation Research: A Hands-on Tutorial 2.0 – Reproducible Manuscripts" was successfully held at ITSC 2025. The session brought together researchers, practitioners, and students for a practical deep dive into tools and workflows that support fully reproducible manuscripts.

### Lyon Presentation (September 2025)

Dr. Michail Makridis (ETH Zürich), the secretary of the RERITE steering committee, was invited to present their work entitled "Reproducibility in transportation research: First insights from transport simulation studies" at ENTPE in Lyon, France on 30th September, 2025. The full paper is open access and is available [[here]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12544-025-00718-9).

### TRS Rotterdam 2025

Ruth Lu, an undergraduate researcher at MIT from our working group, gave our first conference presentation at the Transportation Research Symposium in Rotterdam, The Netherlands! We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the state of data and code availability in transportation research.

### CPS-IoT Week 2025

We organized a tutorial together with [CPS Virtual Organization](https://cps-vo.org/) on "Going Public with Your CPS Code and Data" at CPS-IoT Week 2025. All the material from this tutorial is available [here](https://cps-vo.org/group/2025CPSTutorial). A small step further can make great strides in reproducibility.

### ITSC 2024 Tutorial

We organized a [hands-on tutorial](itsc24-rr-tutorial/) on "Reproducibility in Transportation Research" at [ITSC2024](https://ieee-itsc.org/2024/), with the following objectives:

1. An introduction to the fundamental concepts and importance of RR to the domain of ITS
2. Provide hands-on training in the use of tools and software that facilitate reproducibility
3. Guide researchers on how to properly document and organize data and project outcomes to foster open science
4. Encourage collaboration among tutorial participants to foster a community that values and practices reproducible research

This tutorial is co-organized by Cathy Wu (Associate Professor at MIT), Bidisha Ghosh (Associate Professor at Trinity College Dublin), Zuduo Zheng (Professor at the University of Queensland), and Irene Martínez (Assistant Professor at the TU Delft). **The tutorial materials are available and can be found [here](itsc24-rr-tutorial/)**.

### TRB 2024 Workshop

We organized a workshop at TRB 2024 on "Reproducible Research (RR) – Why, What, and How" sponsored by eight committees (ACP50, A0020C, AED10, AED50, ED60, AEP40, AEP50, AJE45), at TRB2024. More details of this workshop can be found [here](http://www.connectedandautonomoustransport.com/uploads/2/5/2/6/25268286/acp50-reproducible-research.pdf).

### TRB 2023 Call for Papers

We organized a Call for Papers "Towards Reproducible Transportation Research" at TRB 2023, sponsored by ACP50: Traffic Flow Theory and Characteristics (primary sponsoring committee) and AEP40: Transportation Network Modeling Committee. More details of this event can be found [here](http://www.connectedandautonomoustransport.com/uploads/2/5/2/6/25268286/call_for_paper_reproducible_research_in_transportation_research_final.pdf). As a result, a Lectern Session at TRB2023 was dedicated to Reproducible Transportation Research.
